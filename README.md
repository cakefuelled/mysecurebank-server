Learn Web Application Security by doing!

## Getting started

Run the following commands to get started.

You will have to set your credentials on the `.env` file. For now, copy the .env.example file

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

You can edit .env later with your own credentials (which won't be committed to the repository).

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center) to execute this.

```bash
$ npm install # or yarn install
$ node app.js
```
